  <strong> What a conflict is? </strong>
</h2>

Conflicts are "clashes" between two changes made into the same repository, in other words, if developer 'A' tries to edit a code that developer 'B' is editing, a conflict could happen. To avoid conflicts, it's recommended to work on isolated branches.

  <strong> Example </strong>
</h2>

Assuming the case that in line the 5 of a file (whatever it may be) there's the word "Hello, dog!" and there's a pull request (subject spoiler) that made modifications into the same file and line with the word "Hello, cat!", a conflict inside it should appear. And with that, the person assigned to review that change must decide which of the two changes (or alternatively, both) are kept.

  <strong> How does git help us? </strong>
</h2>

Although, git commonly manages to automatically integrate the new changes made by different developers, a conflict doesn't enter into this aspect, since it consists of decisions that the 'leader' of the project sees more convenient to keep inside the repository. Perhaps we should also point out the fact that conflicts only appear to the developer who is doing the merge, the rest of the team isn't aware of the conflict.

The only thing that git can made is marking the file as a conflicting one, after that, the merge process is going to be stopped until resolved by the assigned developer.

  <strong> How to identify a conflict on git? </strong>
</h2>

<img align="right" width="300px" alt="Dumb Homer" src="https://i0.wp.com/26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loyozijD5F1qb22sko1_500.gif"/>

A conflicting file will have odd additions inside it:
* "<<<<<<< branch"
* "======="
* ">>>>>>> new_branch_to_merge_later"

We'll call these new lines as a "conflict dividing lines"
* The line "=======" is the separator that has the conflict: 
* The upper information of the separator until the line "<<<<<<< branch" is the added content, the new content.
* The bottom information of the separator until the line ">>>>>>> new_branch_to_merge_later" is the already existing content inside the file in the main branch

<h2 align= "center">
  <strong> It can be fixed? </strong>
</h2>

<p>
    Of course it can be. The most effective way to fix the conflict is editing the file, turning back to the example about the dog and cat, what we're supposed to watch into our text file is the following lines: <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Before in 'animals.txt' </strong> <br>
    <img align="right" width="420px" style="margin-right:40px; margin-left:40px" alt="Trying to fix my problems" src="https://c.tenor.com/B7TP3JU7qcAAAAAC/fixed.gif"/>
    <<<<<<< main <br>
    Gato <br>
    ======= <br>
    Perro <br>
    >>>>>>> main <br>
    <br>
    <strong> After in 'animals.txt' </strong> <br>
    Gato <br>
    Perro <br>
</p>

Basically the only thing that has been done in this case was to leave both of the information by erasing the "dividing lines of conflicts". We can do this because their existence were independent of each other and keeping both do not affect the file functionality. 

Once the conflict is solved, we're in the ability to make the fusion of the pull request to the main branch of the repository and and finally make the final commit.

  <strong> Conclusions  </strong>
</h2>

* A conflict arises when two independent branches have edited the same line of a file or when a file has been removed in a branch, but edited in the other.
* Conflicts are commonly seen inside a team environment
* One way to solve a conflict is: manually, this conflict will always be solved by the assigned developer or the "owner" of the repository
